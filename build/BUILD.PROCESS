For detailed build instructions, see:
https://adtpro.com/developing.html

The ADTPro project is using the ca65 macro assembler from
the cc65 project (http://www.cc65.org/).  The file
ADTProBuild-default.properties, if copied to
ADTProBuild.properties, serves as a pointer to where the
assembler lives in your installation.

The web site is built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org/).
Go into the doc directory and run the command "mvn site".
The resulting directory rooted at doc/target/site is
the stuff that gets uploaded to ADTPro.com.

 * Did the Apple /// virtual drive driver change?  If so, copy over
   the new disk image from the git repository and point to it in 
   build.xml with the a3sysutils-vs property.

 * Check for the code that needs to lie within a page boundary.
   Reading a listing, look for these routines:
   Trans:/Trans2:
   rdnibtr:
   aud_send:/aud_receive:   

 * Make sure the version number is updated.  Places where 
   the version number is encoded:
   * build/build.xml: <property name="versionString" value="v.r.m" />
   * doc/pom.xml: <version>v.r.m</version>    <- Note: this one should stay
     at the "current" release level instead of reverting to "v.r.m" because
     it can go into documentation between releases.
   * doc/removemaven.re: s@v\.r\.m@v.r.m@ig;  <- Note: this one should stay
     at the "current" release level instead of reverting to "v.r.m" because
     it can go into documentation between releases.
   * client/src/dos/adt.s: DOS version number, if necessary: version_no	"v.r"

 * Make sure you've got the latest DOS ADT from the GitHub project;
   ensure the default baud rate is changed to 115k in adt.s:
   * Search for pspeed: and make it 6, not 5
   * Search for svspeed: and make it 6, not 5
   * Search for default: and make the '5' in position 4 be '6'

 * Perform a build
   * Ensure you are using the 'all' target
   * Ensure your project properties for the Java Compiler are set to 1.4, not 5.0 or above
     to suit our OSX 10.3.x friends

 * Tests:
   * Ensure all files have a current date on the virtual disks
   * Ensure each bootstrap text content works
   * Ensure that floppy formatting works
   * Ensure audio send/receive works

 * Update doc/src/site/apt/history.apt to have the date and release number, with included content

 * Commit all changes

 * Tag the adtpro project with the version number.
   The standard is:  v_[major]_[minor]_[service]

 * Ungzip/untar the .tar.gz distro on a Mac; delete the non-Mac
   stuff, build a ADTPro-v.r.m.dmg of the ADTPro-v.r.m directory
   (This happens automatically if you just do a regular build on a Mac)  

 * Add .gz, .zip, and .dmg files to the tagged release.  Add the release
   notes to the release.

 * Upload updated web contents (doc/target/site) to ADTPro.com

 * After upload and announcements go out (comp.sys.apple2, etc.)
   change build/build.xml versionString back to unreleased:
   <property name="versionString" value="v.r.m" />

Need to do a batch renumber of dump files?
/* */
infile = "dump.in"
outfile = "dump.out"
counter = 40192 /* or wherever */
do while lines(infile) > 0
  str = LINEIN(infile)
  counthex = d2x(counter)
  str = counthex || str
  call LINEOUT outfile, str
  counter = counter + 10
end
