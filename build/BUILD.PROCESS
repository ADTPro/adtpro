For detailed build instructions, see:
http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/developing.html

The ADTPro project is using the ca65 macro assembler from
the cc65 project (http://www.cc65.org/).  The file
ADTProBuild-default.properties, if copied to
ADTProBuild.properties, serves as a pointer to where the
assembler lives in your installation.

The web site is built using Maven (http://maven.apache.org/).
Go into the doc directory and run the command "mvn site".
The resulting directory rooted at doc/target/site is
the stuff that gets uploaded to Sourceforge.

 * Did the Apple /// virtual drive driver change?  If so, copy over
   the new disk image from the git repository and point to it in 
   build.xml with the a3sysutils-vs property.

 * Check for the code that needs to lie within a page boundary.
   Reading a listing, look for these routines:
   Trans:/Trans2:
   rdnibtr:
   aud_send:/aud_receive:   

 * Make sure the version number is updated.  Places where 
   the version number is encoded:
   * build/build.xml: <property name="versionString" value="v.r.m" />
   * build/build.xml: DOS version number, if necessary: <property name="dosVersionString" value="vrm" />
   * doc/pom.xml: <version>v.r.m</version>
   * doc/removemaven.re: s@v\.r\.m@v.r.m@ig;  <- Note: this one should stay
     at the "current" release level instead of reverting to "v.r.m" because
     it can go into documentation between releases.
   * client/src/dos/adt.s: DOS version number, if necessary: version_no	"v.r"

 * Make sure you've got the latest DOS ADT from the GitHub project;
   ensure the default baud rate is changed to 115k in adt.s:
   * Search for pspeed: and make it 6, not 5
   * Search for svspeed: and make it 6, not 5
   * Search for default: and make the '5' in position 4 be '6'

 * Perform a build
   * Ensure you are using the 'all' target
   * Ensure your project properties for the Java Compiler are set to 1.4, not 5.0 or above
     to suit our OSX 10.3.x friends

 * Tests:
   * Ensure all files have a current date on the virtual disks
   * Ensure each bootstrap text content works
   * Ensure that floppy formatting works
   * Ensure audio send/receive works

 * Update history.apt in doc to have the date and release number, with included content

 * Commit all changes

 * Tag the adtpro project with the version number.
   The standard is:  v_[major]_[minor]_[service]

 * Ungzip/untar the .tar.gz distro on a Mac; delete the non-Mac
   stuff, build a ADTPro-v.r.m.dmg of the ADTPro-v.r.m directory
   (This happens automatically if you just do a regular build on a Mac)  

 * Using the new SourceForge File Release System, navigate to
   the ADTPro project:
   https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/?group_id=170262
   and use whatever system they have in place today to add the release.
   Tag each file for the appropriate platform so it is automatically
   presented to visitors looking to download.

 * Upload updated web contents. use SFTP to web.sourceforge.net
   and User name: SFUSER,adtpro
   Files go into /home/groups/a/ad/adtpro/htdocs; back up the 
   old version first (name it the prior version number),
   and move htdocsOLD/archive to htdocs/archive or the A3 library
   will be inaccessible.  WinSCP is an easy Windows GUI to do the
   uploading and movement with.  I haven't found a good GUI client
   for OSX or Linux.

 * After upload and announcements go out (comp.sys.apple2, Freecode,
   Softpedia, cnet downloads, etc.) change build/build.xml back to
   unreleased: <property name="versionString" value="v.r.m" />

Need to do a batch renumber of dump files?
/* */
infile = "dump.in"
outfile = "dump.out"
counter = 40192 /* or wherever */
do while lines(infile) > 0
  str = LINEIN(infile)
  counthex = d2x(counter)
  str = counthex || str
  call LINEOUT outfile, str
  counter = counter + 10
end
