/*      A NibbleBufferMap is the result of analyzing the different areas of
a nibble buffer, as received by the Apple II in the transfer process.
The entire buffer consists of consecutive areas, each with a different
type:
- A Gap area consists of FF characters, optionally preceded by characters
  read in the process of getting into sync. The latter IS important, 
  because sync can get lost even in the middle of a track, due to bit slip
  marks (unreliable characters). A gap must have a certain minimum length
  to qualify as such; the teoretical minimum is 5, but note that in some
  circumstances we get to read only 4 of them (Beneath Apple DOS, page 3-9).
  All gap bytes were supposed to be 10-bit self sync nibbles on the disk.
  Should something resembling gap bytes occur in the data portion of a disk, 
  there is no way to discern them from a gap. I don't consider this a serious
  problem; chance of this happening is very slim, and even if it happens 
  the analysis will be usable.
- A Field area is a sequence of bytes that are sure to belong to a piece
  of data. On a standard DOS disk this would typically be either an 
  address field or a data field. On a copy-protected disk it can be
  used for anything, so we just call it a "field". A Field always
  immediately follows a Gap, without intervening bytes.
- A Bitslip area are unreliable bytes, found between a Field and a
  Gap. They are the result of ending a write action, thereby destroying
  some bytes that were previously on the disk, and destroying the byte
  sync. These bytes are meaningless.

The serial transfer takes place in such a way that the buffer always 
starts with the first byte of a Field area. So effectively, an entire
buffer (as received) consists of a repitition of Field - Bitslip - Gap
areas. The last area in the buffer is of course probably truncated, and
therefore is NO part of the map. 
The buffer is more than twice as long as an "ideal" track, so dividing it
in such areas helps figure out the length of the track. After all,
it is to be expected that the Field areas (which contain relevant bytes)
repeat after tracklength bytes, and therefore appear twice in the buffer.

Construct a NibbleBufferMap by calling nibbleBufferMapWithBuffer. The
NSData object specified as buffer is not copied, but just retained.
So make sure to release the NibbleBufferMap object afterwards.

Call determineTrackLength to have the object guess the length of the 
track, based on the repitition of areas and values in the track.
The function returns -1 when it could not make sense of the track,
otherwise the track length returned is between cMinTrackLength and
cNibbleTrackLength.
